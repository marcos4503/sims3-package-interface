Acknowledgements for s3pe.

In addition to his mention in the library acknowledgements, I must add
special mention of Atavera for use of his Model handler in the s3pe binary
distribution.  This is needed to support the s3asc export/import helper.

For some time, s3pe has been including Delphy's ViewDDS external helper.
Recently, I took the time to split out the "external helper" part from
the bit that did the "View DDS" work, making a re-useable user control.
Both pieces of code are very simple wrappers over the original Paint.NET
DDS File Type Plugin by Dean Ashton, which is MIT licenced as follows:
